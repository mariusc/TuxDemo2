TuxDemo2
========

Updated version of TuxDemo with the latest version of Cocos2D. The demo runs well on iOS7. 

The user controls Tux the penguin by tapping on the left or right areas of the screen. The goal is to catch the fish. 
This is just a demo, so there are no goals in the game. It just keeps going on and on and on :)
